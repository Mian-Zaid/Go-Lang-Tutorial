Sure! Here are a few simple Go language application ideas that you can work on to learn the basics of Go:

1. **Task List Manager:**
   Create a command-line task list manager that allows users to add, view, and mark tasks as completed. You can use the built-in file I/O functions to store the tasks in a text file.

2. **URL Shortener:**
   Build a URL shortener service that takes a long URL as input and generates a short URL. When users access the short URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL.

3. **Word Frequency Counter:**
   Write a program that reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word. It should display the top N most frequent words along with their counts.

4. **Web Scraper:**
   Create a simple web scraper that fetches data from a website and extracts specific information. For example, you can scrape the latest news headlines or weather information.

5. **Currency Converter:**
   Build a currency converter that allows users to convert between different currencies. You can use an API to fetch real-time exchange rates.

6. **File Encryption/Decryption Tool:**
   Develop a tool that can encrypt and decrypt files using a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES. Allow users to specify a password for encryption and decryption.

7. **RESTful API Server:**
   Create a basic RESTful API server that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a simple data model, such as a list of books or notes.

8. **Chat Application:**
   Implement a simple chat application that allows multiple users to send messages to a common chat room. You can use WebSocket for real-time communication.

9. **Image Resizer:**
   Build an image resizer application that can take an image file as input and resize it to a specified width and height.

10. **Password Generator:**
    Develop a password generator that creates strong random passwords with user-specified length and complexity.

Remember, the best way to learn a new programming language is to start coding and working on small projects. These simple application ideas should help you get started with Go and gradually explore more advanced concepts and libraries as you progress. Good luck with your Go language learning journey!
